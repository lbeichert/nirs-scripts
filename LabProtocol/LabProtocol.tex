\title{File Structure and Backup of NIRS/Systemic/MRS Data}
\author{L.Beichert}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\paragraph*{} During the piglet experiments at the MRI-lab 
\section*{Sorts of Data Files and Their Origins}
\begin{itemize}
\item NIRS-files (.tdf): NIRS work station under \todo{look up path} \url{Desktop/My Documents/LWPxxx/} 
\item systemic data files (.m): main Computer under \url{C://temp/LWPxxx/}
\item 31p MRS files (excel sheets): ask scanning physicist
\end{itemize}

\section*{Structure for Long-Term Saving}
\begin{itemize}
\item The data of one experiment LWPxxx from the study studyName  is to be saved on the main computer into the folder \url{D://data/studyName/LWPxxx/} as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the most recent study log (study\_log.xlsx) goes into \url{/data/study-name/} (overwrite older version)
	\item the NIRS files go into subfolder \url{LWPxxx/nirs/} \\(use USB-stick to transfer data from NIRS work station to main PC)
	\item the systemic files go into subfolder \url{LWPxxx/systemic/}
	\item the 31p excel sheets go into subfolder \url{LWPxxx/phosphorus/}
\end{itemize}
\item Example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item data from experiment LWP330 from the argon-dex study goes into folder \url{D://data/argon-dex/LWP330/}
	\item NIRS files go into \url{data/study-dir/LWP330/nirs}
	\item systemic files go into \url{data/study-dir/LWP330/systemic}
	\item 31p excel sheet goes into \url{data/study-dir/LWP330/phosphorus}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section*{Backup to Nikoleta-Server}
\begin{itemize}
\item For a security backup the complete data is uploaded to the Nikoleta-Server regularly. The server contains a folder for each study that is supposed to be identical with the study folder on the local computer.
\item How to upload data to the Nikoleta server
\begin{itemize}
	\item On the main computer start FileZilla FTP Client
	\item Go to File $\rightarrow$ Site Manager, select 'NikoletaServer', enter username and password and click connect
	\item Navigate to the study directory both on the local and the remote site
	\item In order to upload a new 'LWP'-folder from the local site right-click on it an select 'Upload' in the context menu
	\item After uploading the new data disconnect by clicking 'Server' $\rightarrow$ 'Disconnect'
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
