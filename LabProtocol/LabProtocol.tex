\section{Data Files and Their Origins}
\begin{itemize}
\item NIRS-files (.tdf): NIRS work station under Desktop/My Documents/LWP???/
\item systemic data files (.m): main Computer under C:/temp/LWP???/
\item 31p MRS files (excel sheets): ask scanning physicist
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure for long-time saving}
\begin{itemize}
\item The data of one experiment LWPxxx from the study studyName  is to be saved on the main computer into the folder \todo {look up path} 'D://data/studyName/LWPxxx/' as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the most recent study log goes into '/data/study-name/'
	\item the NIRS files go into subfolder '/nirs'
	\item the systemic files go into subfolder '/systemic'
	\item the 31p excel sheets go into subfolder '/phosphorus'
\end{itemize}
\item Example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item data from experiment LWP330 from the argon-dex study goes into folder '??/data/		argon-dex/LWP330/'
	\item NIRS files go into 'data/study-dir/LWP330/nirs'
	\item systemic files go into 'data/study-dir/LWP330/systemic'
	\item 31p excel sheet goes into 'data/study-dir/LWP330/phosphorus'
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Backup to Nikoleta-Server}
\begin{itemize}
\item For a security backup the complete data is uploaded to the Nikoleta-Server regularly. The server contains a folder for each study \todo {exact structure of nikoletta server}  that is supposed to be identical with the study folder on the local computer.
\item How to upload data to the Nikoleta server
\begin{itemize}
	\item On the main computer start FileZilla FTP Client
	\item Go to File $\rightarrow$ Site Manager, select 'NikoletaServer', enter username and password and click connect
	\item Navigate to the study directory both on the local and the remote site
	\item In order to upload new 'LWP'-folder from the local site right-click on it an select 'Upload' in the context menu
	\item After uploading the new data disconnect by clicking 'Server' $\rightarrow$ 'Disconnect'
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
